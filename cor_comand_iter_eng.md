Certainly! Let's create some exercise problems for each of the behavioral design patterns:

1. **Chain of Responsibility**:
    - **Problem 1: Logging Levels**
        - Imagine you're building a logging system for an application. Implement a chain of responsibility where each handler corresponds to a different logging level (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
        - Define a base handler class with a method to handle the log message. Create concrete handler classes for each logging level.
        - When a log message is generated, it should pass through the chain of handlers, and each handler decides whether to process it or pass it to the next level.
        - Test your implementation by creating log messages and observing how they are handled by the chain.

    - **Problem 2: Purchase Approval Workflow**
        - Suppose you're working on an e-commerce platform. Implement a purchase approval workflow using the chain of responsibility pattern.
        - Create handlers for different approval levels (e.g., user, manager, finance department).
        - When a user submits a purchase request, it should pass through the chain of handlers. Each handler can approve, reject, or escalate the request to the next level.
        - Design the chain so that the request stops when it's approved or rejected, or it reaches the highest level (e.g., finance department).

2. **Command**:
    - **Problem 1: Remote Control System**
        - Build a simple remote control system for a smart home. Define commands for turning on/off lights, adjusting thermostat, and opening/closing curtains.
        - Create command classes (e.g., `LightOnCommand`, `ThermostatAdjustCommand`, `CurtainOpenCommand`) that encapsulate the corresponding actions.
        - The remote control should have buttons for each command. When a button is pressed, execute the associated command.
        - Test your implementation by simulating button presses and observing the effects on the home environment.

    - **Problem 2: Text Editor Undo/Redo**
        - Develop an undo/redo functionality for a text editor using the command pattern.
        - Define commands for actions like typing, deleting, and formatting text. Each command should store the necessary information to reverse its effect.
        - Maintain a command history stack. When a user performs an action, create the corresponding command and push it onto the stack.
        - Implement undo and redo methods that pop commands from the stack and execute them in reverse order.
        - Test your text editor by typing, deleting, formatting, and undoing/redoing actions.

3. **Iterator**:
    - **Problem 1: Custom Collection Iteration**
        - Create a custom collection class (e.g., a linked list, tree, or custom data structure).
        - Implement an iterator for your collection that allows iterating through its elements.
        - The iterator should provide methods like `next()`, `has_next()`, and `current_item()`.
        - Test your iterator by adding elements to your collection and iterating through them using the iterator.

    - **Problem 2: Music Playlist Iterator**
        - Suppose you're building a music player application. Implement an iterator for the playlist.
        - Define a `Song` class with properties like title, artist, and duration.
        - Create a playlist class that holds a list of songs. Implement an iterator for the playlist.
        - Users should be able to iterate through the playlist, skip songs, and check the current playing song.
        - Test your iterator by adding songs to the playlist and iterating through them.

Feel free to tackle these problems, implement solutions, and explore the nuances of these behavioral patterns! ðŸŒŸ
